        <h1>Welcome To The Portfolio Of Richard McFarlane</h1>
        <p>My name is Richard McFarlane I was born and raised in Truro Ns. Some of my hobbies include Rugby, Video games, and riding my motorcycle when ever I can. I am currently enrolled at NSCC as a first year student when I am learning new skills and honing skills I already have.</p> 
        <p>I've played Rugby off and on for the last 13 years and have been constantly playing every year for the last 6 years. About 4 years ago i decided to joing the Truro Saints RFC's board of directors where i have since been helping to run the non-profit club.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite video games over the years have been games such as Halo 3, Call of Duty MW2, Pokemon Soul Silver and currently Warframe. I've been playing video games since I was a little kid so they have become a large part of my life.</p>
        <p>When I was a kid my dad used to take me for rides on his motorcycle so when I turned 16 I decided to get my lisence so i could ride them myself. My first motorcycle was a 1988 katana 600 and i currently drive a 1986 virago 750.</p>
